# 🌍 Global Health Indicators EDA (2000–2020)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global health data across multiple countries between 2000 and 2020. The goal is to explore trends in key indicators such as life expectancy, immunization coverage, infant mortality, and health spending — and uncover insights related to global health progress and inequalities.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

How have key global health indicators evolved across countries and regions between 2000 and 2020, and what patterns or disparities can be observed?

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** WHO / World Bank Global Health Data *(from Kaggle)*
- **Features Include:**
  - Country, Year, Status (Developed/Developing)
  - Life expectancy, Adult mortality, Infant deaths
  - Immunization coverage (Hepatitis B, Polio, etc.)
  - Health expenditure (% of GDP), GDP, Schooling

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocess

*(To be updated as you clean the data)*

- ✅ Loaded dataset with `X` rows and `Y` columns
- ✅ Stripped and standardized column names
- ✅ Handled missing values (describe your method)
- ✅ Converted data types where needed

---

## 📊 Exploratory Analysis & Visualizations

*(To be updated as you build charts)*

### 1. Life Expectancy Over Time
- 📈 Line chart: Global average trend from 2000–2020
- 🌍 Country-level comparisons

### 2. Development Status Comparison
- 📊 Boxplot: Life expectancy by status (Developed vs. Developing)

### 3. Immunization vs. Mortality
- 🔍 Scatter plots and correlation analysis

### 4. Health Spending vs. Life Expectancy
- 💰 Analyzing the effect of investment on outcomes

---

## 🔑 Key Findings

*(Write these as you discover them!)*

- Life expectancy increased globally from 2000 to 2020
- Developing countries show faster improvement but lower overall values
- Immunization rates are strongly negatively correlated with infant mortality
- Some outliers exist (e.g., countries with high GDP but poor health outcomes)

1. Clone the repo or open the Colab notebook
2. Upload the dataset (or load from Kaggle if API is configured)
